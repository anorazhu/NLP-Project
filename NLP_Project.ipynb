        "To improve the semantic understanding of text in resume fields (like Skills, Education, Certifications), we will use pre trained Word2Vec embeddings. These embeddings help capture the meaning and similarity between words — for example, \"Python\" and \"Java\" will be closer in the vector space than unrelated terms. Instead of sparse word counts, this gives us rich numerical representations."
