# 🧠 NLP Project: Resume Screening and Hiring Decision Prediction

## 🎯 Project Goal

The goal of this project is to develop an NLP-based classifier that predicts the most appropriate job category for a candidate based on structured fields from their resume. Rather than working with raw resume text, this project leverages structured data extracted from resumes — such as skills, education, past job titles, and certifications — to perform multiclass classification.
